### 1. Installation
To follow along with this project, you will need to install the following libraries which are not included in the default Anaconda distribution: pandas, numpy, matplotlib and wordcloud.

### 2. Project Motivation
The goal of this project is to analyze the Boston Airbnb market using data from listings, reviews, and a calendar of availability and prices. I was interested in understanding which neighborhoods are the most popular and their price, the relationship between animeties and price, and how prices and availability change over time. Furthermore, I wanted to explore how the guests almost feel when selecting an Airbnb property in Boston.

### 3. File Descriptions
This repository contains three files: listings.csv, reviews.csv, and calendar.csv. Each file contains data on Boston Airbnb properties, including the listing details, reviews left by guests, availability, and prices. Additionally, there is a Jupyter Notebook Boston_airbnb_EDA.ipynb that walks through each step of the data analysis process.

### 4. How to Interact with Your Project
The Jupyter Notebook outlines several steps of data cleaning, data exploration, visualization, and modeling to analyze the Boston Airbnb market. Some of the key findings were the most and least expensive neighborhoods, neighborhoods with the highest number of listings and reviews, booking trends over time, most things that the guest reviews, among others.

### 5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Alongside meeting educational purposes, this project was designed solely for exploration hence no serious licensing process is required for this work. This work serves as an affirmation of the data science skills I've learned through various training programs, including the Udacity Data Science course. Feel free to use any part of the code if helpful to you or let us start a conversation over data analysis.
